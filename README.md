Learning to manage servers is a core full stack engineer skill. Docker/Kubernetes and other notable technologies in this space have had profound impact on service design and IT-developer productivity in the world of DevOPS. Sure, there are serverless technologies like Zeit / Netlify (which may be covered here), but every technology has drawbacks and servers are not going away anytime soon due to them being a commodity premium.
