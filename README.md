Learning to manage servers is a core full stack engineer skill. Docker/Kubernetes and other notable technologies in this space have had profound impact on service design and IT-developer productivity in the world of DevOPS. Sure, there are serverless technologies like Zeit / Netlify (which may be covered here), but every technology has drawbacks and servers are not going away anytime soon due to them being a commodity premium.

## sample
Here is a single-command [Build-Release-Deploy](https://github.com/sjangity/startup-stack/blob/master/deploy-bash/release-php.sh) script I've used extensively on my own VPS servers to deploy my apps to Dev-Staging-Prod environments. Obviously, this is one extra step away from CI/CD, but its a good concept to learn.

## startup-stack
A cost-biased master collection of utilities, deployments and best practices for back-end server support from env setup, deployment, and monitoring to security and scale. Focused on function and segmented out by tool or language per integration needs. My goal is to offer practical, viable, production-ready solutions.
